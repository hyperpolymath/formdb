[.lead]
Security architecture, authentication models, and hardening guidelines for FormDB.

[NOTE]
====
**Status: Work in Progress**

This document outlines the planned security architecture. Implementation is ongoing.
====

== Security Model

=== Core Principles

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Principle | Description

| Auditability First
| Every operation is journaled with provenance

| Constraint Enforcement
| All constraints enforced at bridge layer

| No Silent Failures
| Rejections always include explanations

| Reversibility
| Operations can be undone (or explicitly marked irreversible)
|===

== Authentication

=== Planned Authentication Methods

* [ ] **API Keys** - Simple token-based auth
* [ ] **JWT** - Stateless tokens with claims
* [ ] **OIDC/OAuth2** - Enterprise SSO integration
* [ ] **mTLS** - Mutual TLS for service-to-service
* [ ] **FIDO2/WebAuthn** - Passwordless authentication (future)

=== Multi-Tenant Model

_Documentation coming soon._

FormDB supports multi-tenancy with:

* Database-level isolation
* Collection-level permissions
* Row-level security (planned)

== Authorization

=== Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

_Coming soon_

=== Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)

_Coming soon_

== Security Hardening

=== Network Security

* TLS 1.3 required for all connections
* mTLS recommended for production
* Network segmentation guidelines (coming)

=== Data Security

* Encryption at rest (planned)
* Field-level encryption (planned)
* Key management integration (planned)

=== Threat Model

_Formal threat model documentation coming soon._

== Compliance

=== Supported Compliance Frameworks

* [ ] SOC 2 Type II (planned)
* [ ] GDPR (provenance tracking supports right to erasure)
* [ ] HIPAA (planned)

== Security Reporting

See link:../SECURITY.md[SECURITY.md] for vulnerability reporting procedures.
